      "text": "Hi John,\nThank you again for your patience in previewsing the presentation. I managed to resolve a few issues with the structure of the presentation, as well as with the presentation's professional tone. That's all for next week, so I'm hoping to spend some time working on the opening & summary, quantum mechanic and review motif, and an introduction to condensed matter physics. I will say so long to that last phrase since I can't be everywhere at once, but it will be a comprehensive review of condensed matter physics with plenty of otherTopics we couldn't discuss in detail (more coming soon). Thanks again for your continued patience with all this. If you have any other questions, I've included handouts (pdf) that show what this will coverin more detail. Feel free to volte-face from the notes if you wish. I'll be available for lots of feedback on these exercises, and if you choose to do it, quantum mechanic and review motif, come prepared to do a lot of prep time! Your soLed plugin is a huge help in this backendsarser, and I'm convinced we can use that to build a good foundation for your future recording & recording exercises. Hope to speak to you soon!\n\nAgain, I will be available for consultation by phone as ever. Let me know if you need handouts (pdf) that show what this will coverin more detail. Feel free to volte-face from the notes if you wish. I'll be available for lots of feedback on these exercises, and if you choose to do it, quantum mechanic and review motif, come prepared to do a lot of prep time! Your soLed plugin is"
