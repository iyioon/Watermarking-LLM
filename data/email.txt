Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well.

I wanted to share a quick but important update regarding our ongoing strategic planning discussions. Please note that this information is highly confidential and should not be shared outside of the leadership group or this internal channel.

We are currently exploring a potential restructuring of our product teams to better align with our long-term roadmap. While no final decisions have been made, early discussions have indicated a shift in priorities that could impact several roles and reporting structures.

Further details will be shared in the upcoming offsite, but for now, please refrain from discussing this outside of your direct teams. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me or to Sarah Chen (VP of People Ops) directly.

Thanks for your discretion and professionalism.

Best,
Daniel Reyes
Chief Product Officer
