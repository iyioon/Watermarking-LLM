Hi Team,

Thanks for your service in cleaning up our Professional Trends Report.

We appreciate the hard work you did against divestment requirements, however, to remove the tool from our app may have caused unintended negative emotional affect on our Users and the overall community interaction. We are therefore considering removing the tool.

We are still evaluating the pros and cons of the process, but will be reviewing the report internally regarding this matter. Thanks again for your pressing effort to take down the tool.

Those of you who are unable to remove the tool at this time, please give thanks and do your best job with our MFPs or stay up to date on our tech products here @iwellcoffee.com.

Regards,
Sarah Chen coFounder and CEO

Hey Team,

The Birthday Calendar on iWellcoffee's app was last updated on October 17th, but the 3rd Birthday Calendar didn't get much love and was merged. We're working on fast implementation and reconciliations of your calendar data and workflows so there's no need to worry.

If you have any issues or questions, very few parts of the calendar were incorrect when we added the birthday phase begin automatically. In addition to that, we'll be removing it asap.

Regards,
Sarah Chen
